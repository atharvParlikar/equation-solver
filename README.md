# EQ-solve is a equation simplification program and can be used to generate mathematical proofs

how does eq work..

we start with a couple of equations and we call them axioms which do not need to be prooven and be look for similer patterns and keep solving them
imagine this is an axiom (A + B)^2 = A^2 + 2AB + B^2
now whenever eq will see an expression like this it will convert it to the expanded form


# TODO:
1. solve for x in degree 1 equations add or substract.
      
    - example: 1 + x = 3; so x = 3 - 1 = 2
